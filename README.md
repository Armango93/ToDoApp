ToDoApp has two lists: list for current tasks which are actual and undone called "Current", list for done task called "Done". You can switch pads with different lists swiping from left to right and from right to left.

Into the "Current" list you can see text delimiter which can be one of the following: "Overdue", "Today", "Tomorrow" and "Future". It shows to user what of his tasks are not done on time, which ones are actual and planned to be done today or in the future.

If user wants to move the task from one list to another, he need to tap on the colored circle. Color of the circle on the left side of each task mean the priority of this task: red for high priority, green for normal priority and blue for low priority.
